It is recommended to set the taskbar to be 4 levels high, for extra taskbar
space to complement the desktop icons, these all fit very well.

Basically, with the taskbar set to 4 levels high, you can have 10 rows of icons and 25 columns of icons horizontally.
Which, I think, is the way it should be.

I recommend this registry change for people who want more taskbar space while also having lots of space for the icons on desktop.
This is what Windows should have done by default. But I measured things out pixel by pixel. You can thank me later.
